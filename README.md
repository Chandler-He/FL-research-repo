## Datasets
| Dataset | Description |
|-----------|------------------------|
|[Street Dataset](https://github.com/FederatedAI/research/tree/main/datasets/federated_object_detection_benchmark)|A real-world object detection dataset that annotates images captured by a set of street cameras based on object present in them, including 7 object categories.|
|[Fed_ModelNet40](https://github.com/FederatedAI/research/tree/main/datasets/Fed_Multiview_Gen)|It consists of images taken from various views of 3D models, and can be used for vertical federated learning research.|
|NUS WIDE|To simulate a vertical federated learning setting, the image features of samples is put on one party and the textual tags on another party.|
|[CheXpert](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/)|CheXpert is a large dataset of chest X-rays and can be used for vertical federated learning research.|
