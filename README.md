# Federated Learning Research at Webank AI

This repository contains research projects in federated learning from Webank AI group. It includes:

1. [Datasets](#datasets). Preprocessing codes of datasets we used and developed for federated learning research. 
2. [Publications](#publications). Implementation codes of our publications.
3. [Projects](#projects). Other projects in federated learning.

## NEWS
<b>2020-11-06.</b> The research directory is moved out from FATE project as an independent repository. Now you can get our latest research by staring this repo.


## Datasets
| Dataset | Description |
|-----------|------------------------|
|[Street Dataset](https://github.com/FederatedAI/research/tree/main/datasets/federated_object_detection_benchmark)|A real-world object detection dataset that annotates images captured by a set of street cameras based on object present in them, including 7 object categories.|
|[Fed_ModelNet40](https://github.com/FederatedAI/research/tree/main/datasets/Fed_Multiview_Gen)|It consists of images taken from various views of 3D models, and can be used for vertical federated learning research.|
|NUS WIDE|To simulate a vertical federated learning setting, the image features of samples is put on one party and the textual tags on another party.|
|[CheXpert](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/)|CheXpert is a large dataset of chest X-rays and can be used for vertical federated learning research.|
